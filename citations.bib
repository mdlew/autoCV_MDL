  abstract = {Biomolecular condensates form via macromolecular phase separation. Here, we report results from our characterization of synthetic condensates formed by phase separation of mixtures comprising two types of RNA molecules and the biocompatible polymer polyethylene glycol. Purine-rich RNAs are scaffolds that drive phase separation via heterotypic interactions. Conversely, pyrimidine-rich RNA molecules are adsorbents defined by weaker heterotypic interactions. They adsorb onto and wet the interfaces of coexisting phases formed by scaffolds. Lattice-based simulations reproduce the phenomenology observed in experiments and these simulations predict that scaffolds and adsorbents have different non-random orientational preferences at interfaces. Dynamics at interfaces were probed using single-molecule tracking of fluorogenic probes bound to RNA molecules. These experiments revealed dynamical anisotropy at interfaces whereby motions of probe molecules parallel to the interface are faster than motions perpendicular to the interface. Taken together, our findings have broad implications for designing synthetic condensates with tunable interfacial properties.},

Simulations predict that condensates formed by intrinsically disordered proteins are network fluids defined by spatially inhomogeneous organization of the underlying molecules. Here, we test these predictions and find that molecules within condensates are organized into slow-moving nanoscale clusters and fast-moving dispersed molecules. These results, obtained using single-fluorogen tracking and super-resolution imaging of different disordered protein-based condensates, affirm the predicted spatially inhomogeneous organization of molecules within condensates. We map the internal environments and interfaces of condensates using fluorogens that localize differently to the interiors versus interface between dilute phase and condensate. We show that nanoscale clusters within condensates are more hydrophobic than regions outside the clusters, and regions within condensates that lie outside clusters are more hydrophobic than coexisting dilute phases. Our findings provide a structural and dynamical basis for the viscoelasticity of condensates.},

We present POLCAM, a simplified SMOLM method based on polarized detection using a polarization camera, which can be easily implemented on any wide-field fluorescence microscope. To make polarization cameras compatible with single-molecule detection, we developed theory to minimize field-of-view errors, used simulations to optimize experimental design and developed a fast algorithm based on Stokes parameter estimation that can operate over 1,000-fold faster than the state of the art, enabling near-instant determination of molecular anisotropy. To aid in the adoption of POLCAM, we developed open-source image analysis software and a website detailing hardware installation and software use. To illustrate the potential of POLCAM in the life sciences, we applied our method to study {$\alpha$}-synuclein fibrils, the actin cytoskeleton of mammalian cells, fibroblast-like cells and the plasma membrane of live human T cells.},

  abstract = {Many biophysical techniques, such as singlemolecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer, and fluorescence anisotropy, measure the translation and rotation of biomolecules to quantify molecular processes at the nanoscale. These methods often simplify data analysis by assuming isotropic rotational diffusion, e.g., that molecules wobble within a circular cone. This simplification ignores the anisotropy present in many biological contexts that may cause molecules to exhibit different degrees of diffusion in different directions. Here, we loosen this assumption and establish a theoretical framework for describing and measuring anisotropic rotational diffusion using fluorescence imaging. We show that anisotropic wobble is directly quantified by the eigenvalues of a 3-by-3 positive-semidefinite Hermitian matrix M consisting of the second-order moments of a molecule's transition dipole {$\mu$}. This formalism enables us to model the influence of unavoidable shot noise using a Hermitian perturbation matrix E; the eigenvalues of E directly bound errors in measurements of wobble via Weyl's inequality. Quantifying various perturbations E reveals that anisotropic wobble measurements are generally more sensitive to errors compared to quantifying isotropic wobble. Moreover, severe shot noise can induce negative eigenvalues in estimates of M, thereby causing the anisotropic wobble measurement to fail. Our analysis, using Fisher information, shows that techniques with worse orientation measurement sensitivity experience stronger perturbations E and require larger signal to background ratios to measure anisotropic rotational diffusion accurately. Our work provides deep insights for improving the state of the art in imaging the orientations and anisotropic rotational diffusion of single molecules.},

Here, we apply time-lapse singlemolecule orientation-localization microscopy (SMOLM) to measure the orientations and rotational ``wobble'' of Nile blue (NB) molecules transiently binding to A{$\beta$}42 fibrils. We correlate fibril architectures measured by SMOLM with their growth and decay over the course of 5 to 20 min visualized by single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). We discover that stable A{$\beta$}42 fibrils tend to be well-ordered and signified by well-aligned NB orientations and small wobble. SMOLM also shows that increasing order and disorder are signatures of growing and decaying fibrils, respectively. We also observe SMLM-invisible fibril remodeling, including steady growth and decay patterns that conserve {$\beta$}-sheet organization. SMOLM reveals that increased fibril architectural heterogeneity is correlated with dynamic remodeling and that large-scale fibril remodeling tends to originate from strongly heterogeneous local regions.},

We identified distinct intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), including acidic (D/E) tracts and K-blocks interspersed by E-rich regions, as defining features of nucleolar proteins. We show that the localization preferences of nucleolar proteins are determined by their IDRs and the types of RNA or DNA binding domains they encompass. In vitro reconstitutions and studies in cells showed how condensation, which combines binding and complex coacervation of nucleolar components, contributes to nucleolar organization. D/E tracts of nucleolar proteins contribute to lowering the pH of co-condensates formed with nucleolar RNAs in vitro. In cells, this sets up a pH gradient between nucleoli and the nucleoplasm. By contrast, juxta-nucleolar bodies, which have different macromolecular compositions, featuring protein IDRs with very different charge profiles, have pH values that are equivalent to or higher than the nucleoplasm. Our findings show that distinct compositional specificities generate distinct physicochemical properties for condensates.},

Further, their polymorphs are difficult to characterize by using spectroscopic and imaging techniques that rely on ensemble averaging to achieve high resolution. Here, we utilize Nile red (NR), an amyloidophilic fluorogenic probe, and single-molecule orientation-localization microscopy (SMOLM) to characterize fibrils formed by the designed amphipathic enantiomers KFE8L and KFE8D and the pathological amyloid-beta peptide A{$\beta$}42. Importantly, NR SMOLM reveals the helical (bilayer) ribbon structure of both KFE8 and A{$\beta$}42 and quantifies the precise tilt of the fibrils' inner and outer backbones in relevant buffer conditions without the need for covalent labeling or sequence mutations. SMOLM also distinguishes polymorphic branched and curved morphologies of KFE8, whose backbones exhibit much more heterogeneity than those of typical straight fibrils. Thus, SMOLM is a powerful tool to interrogate the structural differences and polymorphism between engineered and pathological cross-{$\beta$}-rich fibrils.},

Since the emissive state of each fluorophore is modulated by electrochemical potential, the number of emitting single molecules follows a sigmoid function during a potential scan, and we thus optically determine the formal redox potential of each dye. We find that the presence of redox mediators (phenazine methosulfate and riboflavin) functions as an electrochemical switch on each dye's emissive state and observe significantly altered electrochemical potential and kinetics. We are therefore able to measure optically how redox mediators and the solid-state electrode modulate the redox state of fluorescent molecules, which follows an electrocatalytic (EC{$\prime$}) mechanism, with SM sensitivity over a 900 {$\mu$}m               2               field of view.

Here, we propose a simple heuristic for designing a point spread function (PSF) that allows for precise measurement of the distance between two emitters. We discover that there are two types of PSFs that achieve high performance for resolving emitters in 3D, as quantified by the Cram{\'e}r-Rao bounds for estimating the separation between two closely spaced emitters. One PSF is very similar to the existing Tetrapod PSFs; the other is a rotating single-spot PSF, which we call the crescent PSF. The latter exhibits excellent performance for localizing single emitters throughout a 1-{\textmu}m focal volume (localization precisions of 7.3 nm in x, 7.7 nm in y, and 18.3 nm in z using 1000 detected photons), and it distinguishes between one and two closely spaced emitters with superior accuracy (25-53\% lower error rates than the best-performing Tetrapod PSF, averaged throughout a 1-{\textmu}m focal volume). Our study provides additional insights into optimal strategies for encoding 3D spatial information into optical PSFs.},
