  abstract = {Biomolecular condensates form via macromolecular phase separation. Here, we report results from our characterization of synthetic condensates formed by phase separation of mixtures comprising two types of RNA molecules and the biocompatible polymer polyethylene glycol. Purine-rich RNAs are scaffolds that drive phase separation via heterotypic interactions. Conversely, pyrimidine-rich RNA molecules are adsorbents defined by weaker heterotypic interactions. They adsorb onto and wet the interfaces of coexisting phases formed by scaffolds. Lattice-based simulations reproduce the phenomenology observed in experiments and these simulations predict that scaffolds and adsorbents have different non-random orientational preferences at interfaces. Dynamics at interfaces were probed using single-molecule tracking of fluorogenic probes bound to RNA molecules. These experiments revealed dynamical anisotropy at interfaces whereby motions of probe molecules parallel to the interface are faster than motions perpendicular to the interface. Taken together, our findings have broad implications for designing synthetic condensates with tunable interfacial properties.},

Simulations predict that condensates formed by intrinsically disordered proteins are network fluids defined by spatially inhomogeneous organization of the underlying molecules. Here, we test these predictions and find that molecules within condensates are organized into slow-moving nanoscale clusters and fast-moving dispersed molecules. These results, obtained using single-fluorogen tracking and super-resolution imaging of different disordered protein-based condensates, affirm the predicted spatially inhomogeneous organization of molecules within condensates. We map the internal environments and interfaces of condensates using fluorogens that localize differently to the interiors versus interface between dilute phase and condensate. We show that nanoscale clusters within condensates are more hydrophobic than regions outside the clusters, and regions within condensates that lie outside clusters are more hydrophobic than coexisting dilute phases. Our findings provide a structural and dynamical basis for the viscoelasticity of condensates.},

We present POLCAM, a simplified SMOLM method based on polarized detection using a polarization camera, which can be easily implemented on any wide-field fluorescence microscope. To make polarization cameras compatible with single-molecule detection, we developed theory to minimize field-of-view errors, used simulations to optimize experimental design and developed a fast algorithm based on Stokes parameter estimation that can operate over 1,000-fold faster than the state of the art, enabling near-instant determination of molecular anisotropy. To aid in the adoption of POLCAM, we developed open-source image analysis software and a website detailing hardware installation and software use. To illustrate the potential of POLCAM in the life sciences, we applied our method to study {$\alpha$}-synuclein fibrils, the actin cytoskeleton of mammalian cells, fibroblast-like cells and the plasma membrane of live human T cells.},

  abstract = {Many biophysical techniques, such as singlemolecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer, and fluorescence anisotropy, measure the translation and rotation of biomolecules to quantify molecular processes at the nanoscale. These methods often simplify data analysis by assuming isotropic rotational diffusion, e.g., that molecules wobble within a circular cone. This simplification ignores the anisotropy present in many biological contexts that may cause molecules to exhibit different degrees of diffusion in different directions. Here, we loosen this assumption and establish a theoretical framework for describing and measuring anisotropic rotational diffusion using fluorescence imaging. We show that anisotropic wobble is directly quantified by the eigenvalues of a 3-by-3 positive-semidefinite Hermitian matrix M consisting of the second-order moments of a molecule's transition dipole {$\mu$}. This formalism enables us to model the influence of unavoidable shot noise using a Hermitian perturbation matrix E; the eigenvalues of E directly bound errors in measurements of wobble via Weyl's inequality. Quantifying various perturbations E reveals that anisotropic wobble measurements are generally more sensitive to errors compared to quantifying isotropic wobble. Moreover, severe shot noise can induce negative eigenvalues in estimates of M, thereby causing the anisotropic wobble measurement to fail. Our analysis, using Fisher information, shows that techniques with worse orientation measurement sensitivity experience stronger perturbations E and require larger signal to background ratios to measure anisotropic rotational diffusion accurately. Our work provides deep insights for improving the state of the art in imaging the orientations and anisotropic rotational diffusion of single molecules.},

We correlate fibril architectures measured by SMOLM with their growth and decay over the course of 5 to 20 min visualized by single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). We discover that stable A{$\beta$}42 fibrils tend to be well-ordered and signified by well-aligned NB orientations and small wobble. SMOLM also shows that increasing order and disorder are signatures of growing and decaying fibrils, respectively. We also observe SMLM-invisible fibril remodeling, including steady growth and decay patterns that conserve {$\beta$}-sheet organization. SMOLM reveals that increased fibril architectural heterogeneity is correlated with dynamic remodeling and that large-scale fibril remodeling tends to originate from strongly heterogeneous local regions.},

We identified distinct intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), including acidic (D/E) tracts and K-blocks interspersed by E-rich regions, as defining features of nucleolar proteins. We show that the localization preferences of nucleolar proteins are determined by their IDRs and the types of RNA or DNA binding domains they encompass. In vitro reconstitutions and studies in cells showed how condensation, which combines binding and complex coacervation of nucleolar components, contributes to nucleolar organization. D/E tracts of nucleolar proteins contribute to lowering the pH of co-condensates formed with nucleolar RNAs in vitro. In cells, this sets up a pH gradient between nucleoli and the nucleoplasm. By contrast, juxta-nucleolar bodies, which have different macromolecular compositions, featuring protein IDRs with very different charge profiles, have pH values that are equivalent to or higher than the nucleoplasm. Our findings show that distinct compositional specificities generate distinct physicochemical properties for condensates.},

Here, we utilize Nile red (NR), an amyloidophilic fluorogenic probe, and single-molecule orientation-localization microscopy (SMOLM) to characterize fibrils formed by the designed amphipathic enantiomers KFE8L and KFE8D and the pathological amyloid-beta peptide A{$\beta$}42. Importantly, NR SMOLM reveals the helical (bilayer) ribbon structure of both KFE8 and A{$\beta$}42 and quantifies the precise tilt of the fibrils' inner and outer backbones in relevant buffer conditions without the need for covalent labeling or sequence mutations. SMOLM also distinguishes polymorphic branched and curved morphologies of KFE8, whose backbones exhibit much more heterogeneity than those of typical straight fibrils. Thus, SMOLM is a powerful tool to interrogate the structural differences and polymorphism between engineered and pathological cross-{$\beta$}-rich fibrils.},

Since the emissive state of each fluorophore is modulated by electrochemical potential, the number of emitting single molecules follows a sigmoid function during a potential scan, and we thus optically determine the formal redox potential of each dye. We find that the presence of redox mediators (phenazine methosulfate and riboflavin) functions as an electrochemical switch on each dye's emissive state and observe significantly altered electrochemical potential and kinetics. We are therefore able to measure optically how redox mediators and the solid-state electrode modulate the redox state of fluorescent molecules, which follows an electrocatalytic (EC{$\prime$}) mechanism, with SM sensitivity over a 900 {$\mu$}m               2               field of view.

Here, we propose a simple heuristic for designing a point spread function (PSF) that allows for precise measurement of the distance between two emitters. We discover that there are two types of PSFs that achieve high performance for resolving emitters in 3D, as quantified by the Cram{\'e}r-Rao bounds for estimating the separation between two closely spaced emitters. One PSF is very similar to the existing Tetrapod PSFs; the other is a rotating single-spot PSF, which we call the crescent PSF. The latter exhibits excellent performance for localizing single emitters throughout a 1-{\textmu}m focal volume (localization precisions of 7.3 nm in x, 7.7 nm in y, and 18.3 nm in z using 1000 detected photons), and it distinguishes between one and two closely spaced emitters with superior accuracy (25-53\% lower error rates than the best-performing Tetrapod PSF, averaged throughout a 1-{\textmu}m focal volume).

With 5000 photons detected from Nile red (NR) transiently bound within supported lipid bilayers (SLBs), raPol SMOLM achieves 2.9 nm localization precision, 1.5° orientation precision, and 0.17 sr precision in estimating rotational wobble. Within DPPC SLBs, SMOLM imaging reveals the existence of randomly oriented binding pockets that prevent NR from freely exploring all orientations. Treating the SLBs with cholesterol-loaded methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD-chol) causes NR’s orientational diffusion to be dramatically reduced, but curiously NR’s median lateral displacements drastically increase from 20.8 to 75.5 nm (200 ms time lag). These jump diffusion events overwhelmingly originate from cholesterol-rich nanodomains within the SLB. These detailed measurements of single-molecule rotational and translational dynamics are made possible by raPol’s high measurement precision and are not detectable in standard SMLM.},

  abstract = {Within condensed matter, single fluorophores are sensitive probes of their chemical environments, but it is difficult to use their limited photon budget to image precisely their positions, 3D orientations, and rotational diffusion simultaneously. We demonstrate the polarized vortex point spread function (PSF) for measuring these parameters, including characterizing the anisotropy of a molecule’s wobble, simultaneously from a single image. Even when imaging dim emitters (∼500 photons detected), the polarized vortex PSF can obtain 12 nm localization precision, 4°−8° orientation precision, and 26° wobble precision. We use the vortex PSF to measure the emission anisotropy of fluorescent beads, the wobble dynamics of Nile red (NR) within supported lipid bilayers, and the distinct orientation signatures of NR in contact with amyloid-beta fibrils, oligomers, and tangles. The unparalleled sensitivity of the vortex PSF transforms single-molecule microscopes into nanoscale orientation imaging spectrometers, where the orientations and wobbles of individual probes reveal structures and organization of soft matter that are nearly impossible to perceive by using molecular positions alone.},

  abstract = {The surface structure of semiconductor photocatalysts controls the efficiency of charge-carrier extraction during photocatalytic reactions. However, understanding the connection between surface heterogeneity and the locations where photogenerated charge carriers are preferentially extracted is challenging. Herein we use single-molecule fluorescence imaging to map the spatial distribution of active regions and quantify the activity for both photocatalytic oxidation and reduction reactions on individual bismuth oxybromide (BiOBr) nanoplates. Through a coordinatebased colocalization analysis, we quantify the spatial correlation between the locations where fluorogenic probe molecules are oxidized and reduced on the surface of individual nanoplates. Surprisingly, we observed two distinct photochemical behaviors for BiOBr particles prepared within the same batch, which exhibit either predominantly uncorrelated activity where electrons and holes are extracted from different sites or colocalized activity in which oxidation and reduction take place within the same nanoscale regions. By analyzing the emissive properties of the fluorogenic probes, we propose that electrons and holes colocalize at defectdeficient regions, while defects promote the selective extraction of one carrier type by trapping either electrons or holes. Although previous work has used defect engineering to enhance the activity of bismuth oxyhalides and other semiconductor photocatalysts for useful reductive half-reactions (e.g., CO2 or N2 reduction), our results show that defect-free regions are needed to promote both oxidation and reduction in fuel-generating photocatalysts that do not rely on sacrificial reagents.},

We demonstrate that our method, termed Wasserstein-induced flux (WIF), measures the accuracy of various reconstruction algorithms directly on experimental 2D and 3D data of microtubules and amyloid fibrils. We further show that WIF confidences can be used to evaluate the mismatch between computational models and imaging data, enhance the accuracy and resolution of reconstructed structures, and discover hidden molecular heterogeneities. As a computational methodology, WIF is broadly applicable to any SMLM dataset, imaging system, and localization algorithm.},

Directly measuring the orientation and spatial organization of large collections ({$>$} 3000 molecules mm@2) of single molecules with nanoscale resolution remains elusive. In this paper, we utilize SMOLM, single-molecule orientation localization microscopy, to directly measure the orientation spectra (3D orientation plus “wobble”) of lipophilic probes transiently bound to lipid membranes, revealing that Nile red s (NR) orientation spectra are extremely sensitive to membrane chemical composition. SMOLM images resolve nanodomains and enzyme-induced compositional heterogeneity within membranes, where NR within liquid-ordered vs. liquid-disordered domains shows a 48 difference in polar angle and a 0.3p sr difference in wobble angle. As a new type of imaging spectroscopy, SMOLM exposes the organizational and functional dynamics of lipid-lipid, lipid-protein, and lipid-dye interactions with single-molecule, nanoscale resolution.},

We use quantum estimation theory and Fisher information (QFI) to derive a fundamental bound on the precision of estimating the orientations of rotationally fixed molecules. While direct imaging of the microscope pupil achieves the quantum bound, it is not compatible with widefield imaging, so we propose an interferometric imaging system that also achieves QFI-limited measurement precision. Extending our analysis to rotationally diffusing molecules, we derive conditions that enable a subset of second-order dipole orientation moments to be measured with quantum-limited precision. Interestingly, we find that no existing techniques can measure all second moments simultaneously with QFI-limited precision; there exists a fundamental trade-off between precisely measuring the mean orientation of a molecule versus its wobble. This theoretical analysis provides crucial insight for optimizing the design of orientation-sensitive imaging systems.},

In this Letter, we show that singlemolecule fluorescence imaging of a chemically activated fluorogenic probe can be used to monitor changes in the photocatalytic activity of bismuth oxybromide (BiOBr) nanoplates in situ during the light-induced formation of oxygen vacancies. We observe that the specific activities of individual nanoplates for the photocatalytic reduction of resazurin first increase and then progressively decrease under continuous laser irradiation. Ensemble structural characterization, supported by electronic-structure calculations, shows that irradiation increases the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies in the nanoplates, reduces Bi ions, and creates donor defect levels within the band gap of the semiconductor particles. These combined changes first enhance photocatalytic activity by increasing light absorption at visible wavelengths. However, high concentrations of oxygen vacancies lower the photocatalytic activity both by introducing new relaxation pathways that promote charge recombination before photoexcited electrons can be extracted and by weakening binding of resazurin to the surface of the nanoplates.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous measurements of single-molecule positions and orientations provide critical insight into a variety of biological and chemical processes. Various engineered point spread functions (PSFs) have been introduced for measuring the orientation and rotational diffusion of dipole-like emitters, but the widely used Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) only evaluates performance for one specific orientation at a time. Here, we report a performance metric, termed variance upper bound (VUB), that yields a global maximum CRB for all possible molecular orientations, thereby enabling the measurement performance of any PSF to be computed efficiently (                                                                                               ∼                                                                                  1000                                        ×                                                                                       faster than calculating average CRB). Our VUB reveals that the simple polarized standard PSF provides robust and precise orientation measurements if emitters are near a refractive index interface. Using this PSF, we measure the orientations and positions of Nile red (NR) molecules transiently bound to amyloid aggregates. Our super-resolved images reveal the main binding mode of NR on amyloid fiber surfaces, as well as structural heterogeneities along amyloid fibrillar networks, that cannot be resolved by single-molecule localization alone.},

Here, we report the use of chemically triggered fluorogenic probes to study the spatial distribution of active regions in individual tungsten oxide nanowires using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. The nanowires show significant heterogeneity along their lengths for the photocatalytic generation of hydroxyl radicals. Through quantitative, coordinate-based colocalization of multiple probe molecules activated by the same nanowires, we demonstrate that the nanoscale regions most active for the photocatalytic generation of hydroxyl radicals also possess a greater concentration of oxygen vacancies. Chemical modifications to remove or block access to surface oxygen vacancies, supported by calculations of binding energies of adsorbates to different surface sites on tungsten oxide, show how these defects control catalytic activity at both the ensemble and single-particle levels. These findings reveal that clusters of oxygen vacancies activate surface-adsorbed water molecules toward photo-oxidation to produce hydroxyl radicals, a critical intermediate in several photocatalytic reactions.},

To fully benefit from their optimality, algorithms must estimate multidimensional parameters such as molecular position and orientation in the presence of PSF overlap and model-experiment mismatches. Here, we present a novel joint sparse deconvolution algorithm based on the decomposition of fluorescence images into six basis images that characterize molecular orientation. The proposed algorithm exploits a group-sparsity structure across these basis images and applies a pooling strategy on corresponding spatial features for robust simultaneous estimates of the number, brightness, 2D position, and 3D orientation of fluorescent molecules. We demonstrate this method by imaging DNA transiently labeled with the intercalating dye YOYO-1.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) depends on sequential detection and localization of individual molecular blinking events. Due to the stochasticity of single-molecule blinking and the desire to improve SMLM’s temporal resolution, algorithms capable of analyzing frames with a high density (HD) of active molecules, or molecules whose images overlap, are a prerequisite for accurate location measurements. Thus far, HD algorithms are evaluated using scalar metrics, such as root-mean-square error, that fail to quantify the               structure               of errors caused by the               structure               of the sample. Here, we show that the spatial distribution of localization errors within super-resolved images of biological structures are vectorial in nature, leading to systematic structural biases that severely degrade image resolution. We further demonstrate that the shape of the microscope’s point-spread function (PSF) fundamentally affects the characteristics of imaging artifacts. We built a Robust Statistical Estimation algorithm (RoSE) to minimize these biases for arbitrary structures and PSFs. RoSE accomplishes this minimization by estimating the likelihood of blinking events to localize molecules more accurately and eliminate false localizations. Using RoSE, we measure the distance between crossing microtubules, quantify the morphology of and separation between vesicles, and obtain robust recovery using diverse 3D PSFs with unmatched accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Classic fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, and single-molecule super-resolution microscopy were used to investigate the cellular handling of doxorubicin-prodrug and AlexaFluor-488-prodrug. Sn-2 phosphatidylcholine prodrugs delivered by hemifusion of nanoparticle and cell phospholipid membranes functioned as phosphatidylcholine mimics, circumventing the challenges of endosome sequestration and release. Phosphatidylcholine prodrugs in the outer cell membrane leaflet translocated to the inner membrane leaflet by ATP-dependent and ATP-independent mechanisms and distributed broadly within the cytosolic membranes over the next 12 h. A portion of the phosphatidylcholine prodrug populated vesicle membranes trafficked to the perinuclear Golgi/ER region, where the drug was enzymatically liberated and activated. Native doxorubicin entered the cells, passed rapidly to the nucleus, and bound to dsDNA, whereas DOX was first enzymatically liberated from DOX-prodrug within the cytosol, particularly in the perinuclear region, before binding nuclear dsDNA. Much of DOX-prodrug was initially retained within intracellular membranes. In vitro anti-proliferation effectiveness of the two drug delivery approaches was equivalent at 48 h, suggesting that residual intracellular DOX-prodrug may constitute a slow-release drug reservoir that enhances effectiveness. We have demonstrated that Sn-2 phosphatidylcholine prodrugs function as phosphatidylcholine mimics following reported pathways of phosphatidylcholine distribution and metabolism. Drug complexed to the Sn-2 fatty acid is enzymatically liberated and reactivated over many hours, which may enhance efficacy over time.

However, these oligomers are too small to be resolved by standard light microscopy. We have developed a simple and versatile tool to image amyloid structures by using thioflavin\>T without the need for covalent labeling or immunostaining. The dynamic binding of single dye molecules generates photon bursts that are used for fluorophore localization on a nanometer scale. Thus, photobleaching cannot degrade image quality, allowing for extended observation times. Super‐resolution transient amyloid binding microscopy promises to directly image native amyloid by using standard probes and record amyloid dynamics over minutes to days. We imaged amyloid fibrils from multiple polypeptides, oligomeric, and fibrillar structures formed during different stages of amyloid‐β aggregation, as well as the structural remodeling of amyloid‐β fibrils by the compound epi‐gallocatechin gallate.},

Inspired by dipole radiation patterns, we design and implement a Tri-spot point spread function (PSF) that simultaneously measures the three-dimensional orientation and the rotational mobility of dipole-like emitters across a large field of view. We show that the orientation measurements done using the Tri-spot PSF are sufficiently accurate to correct the anisotropy-based localization bias, from 30\,nm to 7\,nm, in SMLM. We further characterize the emission anisotropy of fluorescent beads, revealing that both 20-nm and 100-nm diameter beads emit light significantly differently from isotropic point sources. Exciting 100-nm beads with linearly polarized light, we observe significant depolarization of the emitted fluorescence using the Tri-spot PSF that is difficult to detect using other methods. Finally, we demonstrate that the Tri-spot PSF detects rotational dynamics of single molecules within a polymer thin film that are not observable by conventional SMLM.},

As a consequence, OCT is susceptible to coherent noise (speckle noise), which imposes significant limitations on its diagnostic capabilities. Here we show speckle-modulating OCT (SM-OCT), a method based purely on light manipulation that virtually eliminates speckle noise originating from a sample. SM-OCT accomplishes this by creating and averaging an unlimited number of scans with uncorrelated speckle patterns without compromising spatial resolution. Using SM-OCT, we reveal small structures in the tissues of living animals, such as the inner stromal structure of a live mouse cornea, the fine structures inside the mouse pinna, and sweat ducts and Meissner’s corpuscle in the human fingertip skin—features that are otherwise obscured by speckle noise when using conventional OCT or OCT with current state of the art speckle reduction methods.},

However, the nanoscale accuracy of localization throughout a 3D single-molecule microscope's field of view has not yet been rigorously examined. By using regularly spaced subdiffraction apertures filled with fluorescent dyes, we reveal field-dependent aberrations as large as 50-100 nm and show that they can be corrected to less than 25 nm over an extended 3D focal volume. We demonstrate the applicability of this technique for two engineered PSFs, the double-helix PSF and the astigmatic PSF.

  abstract = {This Letter presents a means of measuring the dipole orientation of a fluorescent, orientationally fixed single molecule, which uses a specially designed phase mask, termed a "quadrated pupil," conjugate to the back focal plane of a conventional wide-field microscope. The method leverages the spatial anisotropy of the far-field emission pattern of a dipole emitter and makes this anisotropy amenable to quantitative analysis at the image plane. In comparison to older image-fitting techniques that infer orientation by matching simulations to defocused or excessively magnified images, the quadrated pupil approach is more robust to minor modeling discrepancies and optical aberrations. Precision of 1°-5° is achieved in proof-of-concept experiments for both azimuthal (φ) and polar (θ) angles without defocusing. Since the phase mask is implemented on a liquid-crystal spatial light modulator that may be deactivated without any mechanical perturbation of the sample or imaging system, the technique may be readily integrated into clear aperture imaging studies.},

  abstract = {Recently, single molecule-based superresolution fluorescence microscopy has surpassed the diffraction limit to improve resolution to the order of 20 nm or better. These methods typically use image fitting that assumes an isotropic emission pattern from the single emitters as well as control of the emitter concentration. However, anisotropic single-molecule emission patterns arise from the transition dipole when it is rotationally immobile, depending highly on the molecule’s 3D orientation and               z               position. Failure to account for this fact can lead to significant lateral (               x               ,               y               ) mislocalizations (up to ∼50–200 nm). This systematic error can cause distortions in the reconstructed images, which can translate into degraded resolution. Using parameters uniquely inherent in the double-lobed nature of the Double-Helix Point Spread Function, we account for such mislocalizations and simultaneously measure 3D molecular orientation and 3D position. Mislocalizations during an axial scan of a single molecule manifest themselves as an apparent lateral shift in its position, which causes the standard deviation (SD) of its lateral position to appear larger than the SD expected from photon shot noise. By correcting each localization based on an estimated orientation, we are able to improve SDs in lateral localization from ∼2× worse than photon-limited precision (48 vs. 25 nm) to within 5 nm of photon-limited precision. Furthermore, by averaging many estimations of orientation over different depths, we are able to improve from a lateral SD of 116 (∼4× worse than the photon-limited precision; 28 nm) to 34 nm (within 6 nm of the photon limit).},

  abstract = {Recently, single-molecule imaging and photocontrol have enabled superresolution optical microscopy of cellular structures beyond Abbe's diffraction limit, extending the frontier of noninvasive imaging of structures within living cells. However, live-cell superresolution imaging has been challenged by the need to image three-dimensional (3D) structures relative to their biological context, such as the cellular membrane. We have developed a technique, termed superresolution by power-dependent active intermittency and points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (SPRAIPAINT) that combines imaging of intracellular enhanced YFP (eYFP) fusions (SPRAI) with stochastic localization of the cell surface (PAINT) to image two different fluorophores sequentially with only one laser. Simple light-induced blinking of eYFP and collisional flux onto the cell surface by Nile red are used to achieve single-molecule localizations, without any antibody labeling, cell membrane permeabilization, or thiol-oxygen scavenger systems required. Here we demonstrate live-cell 3D superresolution imaging of Crescentin-eYFP, a cytoskeletal fluorescent protein fusion, colocalized with the surface of the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus using a double-helix point spread function microscope. Three-dimensional colocalization of intracellular protein structures and the cell surface with superresolution optical microscopy opens the door for the analysis of protein interactions in living cells with excellent precision (20-40 nm in 3D) over a large field of view (12 12 μm).},

  abstract = {We describe the corkscrew point spread function (PSF), which can localize objects in three dimensions throughout a 3.2 μm depth of field with nanometer precision. The corkscrew PSF rotates as a function of the axial (z) position of an emitter. Fisher information calculations show that the corkscrew PSF can achieve nanometer localization precision with limited numbers of photons. We demonstrate three-dimensional super-resolution microscopy with the corkscrew PSF by imaging beads on the surface of a triangular polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) grating. With 99,000 photons detected, the corkscrew PSF achieves a localization precision of 2.7 nm in x, 2.1 nm in y, and 5.7 nm in z.},

  abstract = {Wide-field microscopy with a double-helix point spread function (DH-PSF) provides three-dimensional (3D) position information beyond the optical diffraction limit. We compare the theoretical localization precision for an unbiased estimator of the DH-PSF to that for 3D localization by astigmatic and biplane imaging using Fisher information analysis including pixelation and varying levels of background. The DH-PSF results in almost constant localization precision in all three dimensions for a 2\enspace μm thick depth of field while astigmatism and biplane improve the axial localization precision over smaller axial ranges. For high signal-to-background ratio, the DH-PSF on average achieves better localization precision.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional nanoscale localization and tracking of dim single emitters can be obtained with a widefield fluorescence microscope exhibiting a double-helix point spread function (DH-PSF). We describe in detail how the localization precision quantitatively depends upon the number of photons detected and the z position of the nanoscale emitter, thereby showing a ∼10 nm localization capability along x, y, and z in the limit of weak emitters. Experimental measurements are compared to Fisher information calculations of the ultimate localization precision inherent in the DH-PSF. The DH-PSF, for the first time, is used to track single quantum dots in aqueous solution and a quantum dot-labeled structure inside a living cell in three dimensions.},

  abstract = {We report a quantitative differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope based on a structured-aperture (SA) wavefront sensor. Unlike a conventional DIC microscope, the SA-DIC microscope can separate the amplitude and the phase gradient information of the image wavefront, and form quantitative intensity and DIC images of the sample with good resolution; our prototype achieved resolution ∼2\enspace μm. Furthermore, due to the nonpolarization nature of the microscope, we were able to image birefringent samples without artifacts.},

  abstract = {We present a novel on-chip method for quantitative two-dimensional differential phase imaging. This technique uses four circular holes (600 nm diameter, 1.2 mum spacing) arranged in a 'plus' pattern that are fabricated in a layer of metal above a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) imaging sensor. The interference pattern of the aperture shifts position with respect to the differential phase of the incident light. By imaging the interference pattern with the CMOS sensor, this method measures amplitude and differential phase (1 degrees /microm sensitivity for signal-to-noise ratio {$>$}/=16 dB) of the incident light field simultaneously. An application to optical beam profiling is presented; we show the amplitude and differential phase profiles of a Gaussian laser beam and an optical vortex.},
