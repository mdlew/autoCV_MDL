  abstract = {Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) offers enhanced spatial resolution in optical microscopy, providing detailed insights into the spatial organization of proteins in cells at the nanoscale. Over the past decade, SMLM has progressively incorporated the capability to retrieve the orientations of single molecules using their polarized dipolar emission pattern. Here we explore recent advancements in single-molecule orientation and localization microscopy (SMOLM), which yields super-resolved images of molecular three-dimensional (3D) orientations, wobble and 3D positions. This advancement opens possibilities to explore the nanoscale organization and conformation of biological molecules as well as to monitor and design local 3D optical fields in nanophotonics. We cover the principles of SMOLM, discuss recent advances and applications in biology and photonics, and finally highlight exciting future directions and challenges in the field.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Numerous methods for determining the orientation of single‐molecule transition dipole moments from microscopic images of the molecular fluorescence have been developed in recent years. At the same time, techniques that rely on nanometer‐level accuracy in the determination of molecular position, such as single‐molecule super‐resolution imaging, have proven immensely successful in their ability to access unprecedented levels of detail and resolution previously hidden by the optical diffraction limit. However, the level of accuracy in the determination of position is threatened by insufficient treatment of molecular orientation. Here we review a number of methods for measuring molecular orientation using fluorescence microscopy, focusing on approaches that are most compatible with position estimation and single‐molecule super‐resolution imaging. We highlight recent methods based on quadrated pupil imaging and on double‐helix point spread function microscopy and apply them to the study of fluorophore mobility on immunolabeled microtubules.},

  abstract = {Automated processing of double-helix (DH) microscope images of single molecules (SMs) streamlines the protocol required to obtain super-resolved three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of ultrastructures in biological samples by single-molecule active control microscopy. Here, we present a suite of MATLAB subroutines, bundled with an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI), that facilitates 3D localization of single emitters (e.g. SMs, fluorescent beads, or quantum dots) with precisions of tens of nanometers in multi-frame movies acquired using a wide-field DH epifluorescence microscope. The algorithmic approach is based upon template matching for SM recognition and least-squares fitting for 3D position measurement, both of which are computationally expedient and precise. Overlapping images of SMs are ignored, and the precision of least-squares fitting is not as high as maximum likelihood-based methods. However, once calibrated, the algorithm can fit 15-30 molecules per second on a 3 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo workstation, thereby producing a 3D super-resolution reconstruction of 100,000 molecules over a 20×20×2 μm field of view (processing 128×128 pixels × 20000 frames) in 75 min.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy is a ubiquitous tool in biological studies, but fundamental diffraction limits its resolution to \textasciitilde 200 nm for visible light. To overcome this physical limit, but still retain the advantages of far-field noninvasive fluorescence imaging, single-molecule photocontrol has been utilized to achieve optical nanoscopy. Superlocalization, combined with photocontrol of single molecules, allows individual molecules to be localized to precisions of tens of nanometers as part of a larger biological structure, thereby achieving super-resolution. Photoactivation, photoswitching, and photoinduced blinking are all methods of photocontrol, and critical characterization and performance parameters of photocontrollable fluorophores are discussed. We describe two classes of small molecules for use in photoactivation (azido-dicyanomethylenedihydrofuran molecules) and photoswitching (Cy3–Cy5 covalent heterodimer) studies. Furthermore, the use of the first-reported photoswitchable fluorescent protein, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP), is also discussed for photoswitching and for photoinduced blinking experiments. Importantly, all of these methods of photocontrol have demonstrated remarkable usefulness in super-resolution studies of structures in living cells.},

  abstract = {Superresolution imaging of biological structures provides information beyond the optical diffraction limit. One class of superresolution techniques uses the power of single fluorescent molecules as nanoscale emitters of light combined with emission control, variously described by the acronyms PALM/FPALM/STORM and many others. Even though the acronyms differ and refer mainly to different active-control mechanisms, the underlying fundamental principles behind these “pointillist” superresolution imaging techniques are the same. Circumventing the diffraction limit requires two key steps. The first step (superlocalization) is the detection and localization of spatially separated single molecules. The second step actively controls the emitting molecules to ensure a very low concentration of single emitters such that they do not overlap in any one imaging frame. The final image is reconstructed from time-sequential imaging and superlocalization of the single emitting labels decorating the structure of interest. The statistical, imaging, and active-control strategies for achieving superresolution imaging with single molecules are reviewed.},
