# Optimized TeX Live packages for autoCV_MDL
# 
# OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:
# - Keep essential base collections (latex, latexrecommended)
# - Keep LuaTeX collection (engine requirement)
# - REMOVE collection-latexextra (~800+ packages) → replace with individual packages
# - REMOVE collection-fontsextra (~500+ fonts) → use fontsrecommended only
# - REMOVE collection-bibtexextra → use individual biblatex packages
# 
# This reduces installation from ~2000+ packages to ~200-300 packages
# while maintaining all functionality needed for cv.tex compilation.
