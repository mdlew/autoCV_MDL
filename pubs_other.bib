  abstract = {Icy locations on Earth have been found to contain habitable environments and microorganisms with adaptations to cold temperatures. Martian ice, found in polar layered deposits and in the subsurface at mid-latitudes, is therefore a high priority target for future landed missions with astrobiological science objectives. The PERISCOPE instrument is intended to enable in situ organic detection and classification in these environments, and meet the accommodation limitations of small robotic platforms. Here we report on the status of technology maturation efforts to advance PERISCOPE to TRL 5 for a Mars mid-latitude environment, and on science validation efforts to demonstrate organic detection and mapping in the near subsurface. To access the near subsurface, an optical relay system was developed to deliver the laser light to the sample and collect the resulting fluorescence. A fieldable version of PERISCOPE was deployed to the Gilkey Glacier, Juneau, AK, and to volcanic deposits in Bishop, CA. In these environments, PERISCOPE obtained subsurface hyperspectral maps identifying ultraviolet fluorescence hotspots that serve as lines of evidence for the presence of organic matter.},

  abstract = {© COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only. Modulating the polarization of excitation light, resolving the polarization of emitted fluorescence, and point spread function (PSF) engineering have been widely leveraged for measuring the orientation of single molecules. Typically, the performance of these techniques is optimized and quantified using the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB), which describes the best possible measurement variance of an unbiased estimator. However, CRB is a local measure and requires exhaustive sampling across the measurement space to fully characterize measurement precision. We develop a global variance upper bound (VUB) for fast quantification and comparison of orientation measurement techniques. Our VUB tightly bounds the diagonal elements of the CRB matrix from above; VUB overestimates the mean CRB by ∼34\%. However, compared to directly calculating the mean CRB over orientation space, we are able to calculate VUB ∼1000 times faster.},

WIF relies on the observation that accurate localizations are stable with respect to an arbitrary computational perturbation. Inspired by optimal transport theory, we measure the stability of individual localizations and develop an efficient optimization algorithm to compute WIF. We demonstrate the advantage of WIF in accurately quantifying imaging artifacts in high-density reconstruction of a tubulin network. WIF represents an advance in quantifying systematic errors with unknown and complex distributions, which could improve a variety of downstream quantitative analyses that rely upon accurate and precise imaging. Furthermore, thanks to its formulation as layers of simple analytical operations, WIF can be used as a loss function for optimizing various computational imaging models and algorithms even without training data.},

  abstract = {© COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only. Amyloid fibrils and tangles are signatures of Alzheimer disease, but nanometer-sized aggregation intermediates are hypothesized to be the structures most toxic to neurons. The structures of these oligomers are too small to be resolved by conventional light microscopy. We have developed a simple and versatile method, called transient amyloid binding (TAB), to image amyloid structures with nanoscale resolution using amyloidophilic dyes, such as Thioflavin T, without the need for covalent labeling or immunostaining of the amyloid protein. Transient binding of ThT molecules to amyloid structures over time generates photon bursts that are used to localize single fluorophores with nanometer precision. Continuous replenishment of fluorophores from the surrounding solution minimizes photobleaching, allowing us to visualize a single amyloid structure for hours to days. We show that TAB microscopy can image both the oligomeric and fibrillar stages of amyloid-β aggregation. We also demonstrate that TAB microscopy can image the structural remodeling of amyloid fibrils by epi-gallocatechin gallate. Finally, we utilize TAB imaging to observe the non-linear growth of amyloid fibrils.},

  abstract = {Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a powerful biomedical imaging technology that relies on the coherent detection of backscattered light to image tissue morphology in vivo. As a consequence, OCT is susceptible to coherent noise, known as speckle noise, which imposes significant limitations on its diagnostic capabilities. Here we show SpeckleModulating OCT (SM-OCT), a method based purely on light manipulation, which can remove speckle noise, including noise originating from sample multiple back-scattering. SM-OCT accomplishes this by creating and averaging an unlimited number of scans with uncorrelated speckle patterns, without compromising spatial resolution. The uncorrelated speckle patterns are created by scrambling the phase of the light with sub-resolution features using a moving ground-glass diffuser in the optical path of the sample arm. This method can be implemented in existing OCTs as a relatively low-cost add-on. SM-OCT speckle statistics follow the expected decrease in speckle contrast as the number of averaged scans increases. Within a scattering phantom, SM-OCT provides a 2.5-fold increase in effective resolution compared to conventional OCT. Using SM-OCT, we reveal small structures in the tissues of living animals, such as the inner stromal structure of a live mouse cornea, the fine structures inside the mouse pinna, and sweat ducts and Meissner’s corpuscle in the human fingertip skin – features that are otherwise obscured by speckle noise when using conventional OCT or OCT with current state of the art speckle reduction methods. Our results indicate that SM-OCT has the potential to improve the current diagnostic and intra-operative capabilities of OCT.},

In comparison to image-fitting techniques that infer orientation by matching simulations to defocused or excessively magnified images, the quadrated pupil approach is more robust to minor modeling discrepancies, defocus, and optical aberrations. Precision on the order of 1o-5o is achieved in proofof-concept experiments for both azimuthal (φ) and polar (θ) angles. Since the phase mask is implemented on a liquid-crystal spatial light modulator (SLM) that may be deactivated without any mechanical perturbation of the sample or imaging system, the technique may be readily integrated into conventional imaging studies.},

The algorithmic approach is based upon template matching for SM recognition and least-squares fitting for 3D position measurement, both of which are computationally expedient and precise. Overlapping images of SMs are ignored, and the precision of least-squares fitting is not as high as maximum likelihood-based methods. However, once calibrated, the algorithm can fit 15-30 molecules per second on a 3 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo workstation, thereby producing a 3D super-resolution reconstruction of 100,000 molecules over a 20×20×2 μm field of view (processing 128×128 pixels × 20000 frames) in 75 min.},

  abstract = {Single-molecule-based super-resolution fluorescence microscopy has recently been developed to surpass the diffraction limit by roughly an order of magnitude. These methods depend on the ability to precisely and accurately measure the position of a single-molecule emitter, typically by fitting its emission pattern to a symmetric estimator (e.g. centroid or 2D Gaussian). However, single-molecule emission patterns are not isotropic, and depend highly on the orientation of the molecule’s transition dipole moment, as well as its z-position. Failure to account for this fact can result in localization errors on the order of tens of nm for in-focus images, and \textasciitilde 50-200 nm for molecules at modest defocus. The latter range becomes especially important for three-dimensional (3D) single-molecule super-resolution techniques, which typically employ depths-of-field of up to \textasciitilde 2 μm. To address this issue we report the simultaneous measurement of precise and accurate 3D single-molecule position and 3D dipole orientation using the Double-Helix Point Spread Function (DHPSF) microscope. We are thus able to significantly improve dipole-induced position errors, reducing standard deviations in lateral localization from \textasciitilde 2x worse than photon-limited precision (48 nm vs. 25 nm) to within 5 nm of photon-limited precision. Furthermore, by averaging many estimations of orientation we are able to improve from a lateral standard deviation of 116 nm (\textasciitilde 4x worse than the precision, 28 nm) to 34 nm (within 6 nm).},

  abstract = {The point spread function (PSF) of a widefield fluorescence microscope is not suitable for three-dimensional superresolution imaging. We characterize the localization precision of a unique method for 3D superresolution imaging featuring a double-helix point spread function (DH-PSF). The DH-PSF is designed to have two lobes that rotate about their midpoint in any transverse plane as a function of the axial position of the emitter. In effect, the PSF appears as a double helix in three dimensions. By comparing the Cramer-Rao bound of the DH-PSF with the standard PSF as a function of the axial position, we show that the DH-PSF has a higher and more uniform localization precision than the standard PSF throughout a 2 μm depth of field. Comparisons between the DH-PSF and other methods for 3D superresolution are briefly discussed. We also illustrate the applicability of the DH-PSF for imaging weak emitters in biological systems by tracking the movement of quantum dots in glycerol and in live cells.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate a novel method of two-dimensional differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Our method is cheaper, more compact, and more robust compared to conventional DIC microscopes; since it uses a simple variation of Young’s double-slit geometry, no expensive or complex optical components are needed. In addition, our method quantitatively measures differential phase, unlike conventional DIC, which makes our device useful for optical metrology and cell biology applications. The device consists of four circular holes arranged in a “plus” pattern, milled into a metal layer 80 µm above a complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor. Light incident upon the four-hole aperture is transmitted through the holes and creates an interference pattern on the CMOS sensor. This pattern shifts as a function of the spatial phase gradient of the incident light. By capturing the amplitude and location of the zero-order fringe of the interference pattern, the amplitude and differential phase of the incident light can be measured simultaneously. In this article, we model the response of the device using both geometric optics and Huygens principle. We then verify these models by experimentally measuring the responsivity of our device. A short analysis on the algorithm used to calculate the fringe location follows. We then show a beam profiling application by measuring the amplitude and spatial phase gradient of a Gaussian laser beam and an optical vortex. Finally, we show a DIC microscope application; we image a phase mask of the letters “CIT”.},

  abstract = {In this article, we will present a novel differential interference contrast (DIC) phase imaging device based on Young's interference. It is mainly based on either two or four nano apertures defined in an optically opaque aluminum film on a CMOS imaging sensor chip. It provides linear and disentangled differential phase and intensity images simultaneously. Furthermore, it’s simple, free of bulky optical elements and compatible to the planar micro fabrication process. All of these features make it a promising device for the on-chip high resolution DIC phase imaging and beam profiling. The fabrication and operation of the device is explained in details. The performance is evaluated theoretically and is verified experimentally by examining the phase and intensity profile of a Gaussian beam and an optical vortex. The 2D quantitive differential phase distribution of an optical vortex has been recorded directly by our device with 1µm resolution.},
